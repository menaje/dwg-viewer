# Distribution and installation

The [proposed delivery continuity section](#proposed-delivery-continuity) is
informative planning for #53. Existing release routes below remain observed
implementation, with unresolved stage/approval decisions; this document update
does not activate a new route, visibility setting or publication permission.

Status: qualified release procedure for Linux x64, macOS arm64, macOS Intel
x64, and Windows x64.

## Release artifacts

| Artifact | License | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dwg-viewer-vscode-<version>.vsix` | MPL-2.0, plus bundled MIT, ISC and Apache-2.0 components | The only VS Code Marketplace product. It contains the Webview, notices, and a version-bound engine catalog, but no LibreDWG executable. |
| `dwg-viewer-native-converter-<version>-linux-x64` | GPL-3.0-or-later | Exact converter selected by the same viewer version on Linux x64. |
| `dwg-viewer-native-converter-<version>-darwin-arm64` | GPL-3.0-or-later | Exact converter selected by the same viewer version on Apple Silicon. |
| `dwg-viewer-native-converter-<version>-darwin-x64` | GPL-3.0-or-later | Exact converter selected by the same viewer version on Intel macOS. |
| `dwg-viewer-native-converter-<version>-win32-x64.exe` | GPL-3.0-or-later | Exact converter selected by the same viewer version on Windows x64. |
| `dwg-viewer-libredwg-0.14-<target>.tar.gz` | GPL-3.0-or-later; adapter source retains MPL-2.0 notices | Complete corresponding source package for the converter of that target. It includes the binary, exact LibreDWG source, reviewed ACDS SAT/SAB and R2007 high-compression patches, adapter source, build scripts, unmodified license texts, manifest, and checksums. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Not executable | Digests for the main VSIX, four converters, and four source-complete archives. |

The release pipeline builds each converter from checksum-pinned official GNU
LibreDWG 0.14 source on its target operating system. It runs the bounded
`doctor` command and verifies a deterministic source-complete archive before
publishing the raw executable.

The MPL VSIX excludes `native/**` and has no extension dependency on a second
Marketplace product. Its generated `dist/engine-assets.json` records the exact
viewer version, release tag, platform filename, byte length, SHA-256 digest,
adapter protocol, Scene Cache version, and corresponding source asset. Package
tests reject a GPL executable in the VSIX or a missing catalog.

This is an engineering compliance review, not legal advice. The policy follows
the [MPL 2.0 executable-form source requirement](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/),
the [GNU GPL distribution guidance](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html),
and GitHub's
[artifact attestation procedure](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/use-artifact-attestations/use-artifact-attestations).

## Automatic installation model

Installing **2D CAD Viewer for VS Code** activates the extension after VS Code
startup. The extension then:

1. selects `linux-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, or `win32-x64` from the
   extension-host environment;
2. reads only the catalog packaged with that exact extension version;
3. downloads the catalog's converter from the matching `v<version>` GitHub
   Release over HTTPS;
4. rejects an unexpected redirect host, byte length, or SHA-256 digest;
5. writes the executable under the extension's private global storage, keyed by
   viewer version, platform, and digest;
6. runs `doctor` and requires the expected platform, architecture, adapter
   protocol, and Scene Cache `dwg-scene-cache/1.26`; and
7. reuses the verified local executable on later starts.

The converter runs as a separate operating-system process. Updating the viewer
selects a new version-bound catalog and storage directory, so an independently
updated or older converter cannot silently produce an incompatible cache. If a
previous `1.18` cache is found, the cache header check removes and rebuilds it
with the current `1.26` writer.

A configured adapter path, environment override, or historical engine
extension is considered only when automatic installation is unavailable. Every
fallback must pass the same `doctor` compatibility check and cannot override a
healthy version-managed converter.

## Release branches and channels

The product release path is `dev` → `prerelease` → `main`. Direct pushes to
`prerelease` and `main` are blocked; the required `release-route` check accepts
only a same-repository `dev` → `prerelease` pull request or a `prerelease` →
`main` pull request. Closing a pull request without merging it, creating a
branch, pushing a tag, or manually running a dry run cannot publish a release.

VS Code Marketplace versions use `major.minor.patch` without a SemVer suffix.
This repository uses the following channel convention:

- odd minor versions, such as `0.1.5` or `0.3.0`, are prereleases;
- even minor versions, such as `0.2.0` or `0.4.0`, are stable releases;
- the root repository and main extension versions must match; and
- each release version must be greater than every existing `v<version>` product
  tag.

Merging `dev` into `prerelease` with a new odd-minor version publishes a
prerelease. Merging a new even-minor version into `prerelease` is the stable
preparation step: it runs the complete qualification and artifact build without
publishing. After that succeeds, merging `prerelease` into `main` publishes the
stable version.

An independent Viewer package promotion may reuse the current VS Code product
version on `dev` → `prerelease`. The release route accepts that exception only
when every changed path belongs to the bounded Viewer package promotion set,
all three package versions and compatibility records are aligned to a version
newer than every existing `viewer-core-v<version>` tag, and the producer
manifest explicitly approves that exact tag. The merge is classified as
`viewer-package-promotion`, with product artifact build and publication both
disabled. The separate Viewer package workflow performs publication only after
the exact promoted commit receives its approved package tag.

The `Release packages` workflow also has two non-publishing manual modes:
`dry-run` builds and verifies every artifact, while `verify-auth` checks that
the configured `VSCE_PAT` can publish under `menaje`.

For a publishing merge, the workflow:

1. validates the branch route, channel, tag history, and aligned root/viewer
   versions;
2. builds checksum-pinned static converters on all four supported targets;
3. runs `doctor`, creates each source-complete archive twice, and requires
   byte-identical output and valid internal checksums;
4. generates a catalog from the exact converter and source-archive files;
5. builds the MPL VSIX twice with that catalog, normalizes bounded ZIP metadata,
   and requires byte-identical output;
6. inspects the VSIX license, notices, source link, GPL exclusion, and embedded
   catalog;
7. produces build-provenance attestations and `SHA256SUMS` for the complete
   release set;
8. creates the immutable `v<version>` GitHub release, which makes the converter
   URLs usable; and
9. only after the GitHub release succeeds, publishes the single MPL viewer to
   Marketplace with `--pre-release` for the prerelease channel.

This order prevents Marketplace from offering a viewer before its exact engine
assets are available. A release retry may add a missing asset, but it must never
replace an existing asset whose digest differs.

The `darwin-x64` job uses GitHub's `macos-15-intel` runner. Hosted Intel macOS
support must move to a maintained external Intel builder or be retired before
that image is retired.

Marketplace publishing requires the repository Actions secret `VSCE_PAT` with
permission to manage the `menaje` publisher. The token is never stored in a
manifest or artifact. The separately listed historical
`menaje.dwg-viewer-libredwg` package is no longer a product dependency and is
not published by this workflow; it remains in the repository only for legacy
offline and extension-host qualification.

## Reproduce the packages

The release build needs a directory containing all four raw converters and all
four source-complete archives. Generate the version-bound catalog first:

```bash
node scripts/create-engine-catalog.mjs \
  --directory /absolute/path/release-assets \
  --version 0.1.8 \
  --output /absolute/path/engine-assets.json
```

Then build the main package with that exact catalog:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
DWG_VIEWER_ENGINE_CATALOG=/absolute/path/engine-assets.json \
  pnpm --dir apps/vscode-extension run build
pnpm --dir apps/vscode-extension exec vsce package \
  --pre-release \
  --no-dependencies \
  --out /absolute/new/path/dwg-viewer-vscode-0.1.8.vsix
```

Use the checksum-pinned preparation and deterministic packager in
[`adapters/libredwg/README.md`](../adapters/libredwg/README.md) to reproduce a
platform converter and its source-complete archive.

## Verify a downloaded release

Place the main VSIX, four converters, four source-complete archives, and
`SHA256SUMS` in one directory. On Linux:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

On macOS:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

With GitHub CLI, verify provenance for the files you intend to use:

```bash
gh attestation verify dwg-viewer-vscode-0.1.8.vsix \
  --repo menaje/2d-cad-viewer
gh attestation verify dwg-viewer-native-converter-0.1.8-darwin-arm64 \
  --repo menaje/2d-cad-viewer
gh attestation verify dwg-viewer-libredwg-0.14-darwin-arm64.tar.gz \
  --repo menaje/2d-cad-viewer
```

## Install

From Marketplace, install only **2D CAD Viewer for VS Code**. The automatic flow
above prepares the correct converter; there is no engine extension to select or
install.

For a manual VSIX installation:

```bash
code --install-extension dwg-viewer-vscode-0.1.8.vsix
```

If the target computer cannot reach GitHub Releases, copy the matching raw
converter from another verified computer. On Linux or macOS, make only that
file executable and run its self-test:

```bash
chmod 700 dwg-viewer-native-converter-0.1.8-darwin-arm64
./dwg-viewer-native-converter-0.1.8-darwin-arm64 doctor
```

On Windows, run:

```powershell
.\dwg-viewer-native-converter-0.1.8-win32-x64.exe doctor
```

Then run **2D CAD Viewer: LibreDWG 변환기 선택** and choose that verified file.
The command is an offline fallback; it does not replace a healthy automatically
managed converter.

The macOS converter is not notarized with an Apple Developer ID. If macOS
blocks a verified download, use the operating system's Privacy & Security
approval flow for that specific file. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally.

## Publication checklist

- The pull request follows `dev` → `prerelease` or `prerelease` → `main`, and
  required route and CI checks pass.
- Root and main extension versions are identical and follow the channel rule.
- A manual `Release packages` dry run succeeds before the release merge.
- The workflow-created tag is exactly `v<version>` and points to the merged
  commit.
- The main VSIX embeds the catalog generated from the exact release files.
- Main VSIX, all four converters, and all four source-complete archives have
  valid GitHub attestations and match `SHA256SUMS`.
- Existing release assets are never overwritten with different bytes.
- GitHub Release creation succeeds before Marketplace publication.
- Marketplace publication targets only `menaje.dwg-viewer-vscode`.
- The packaged MPL text matches the official canonical text and project
  copyright remains in `NOTICE`.
- The Webview production dependency audit matches the copyright and permission
  notices in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Windows native-path and VS Code display-scale qualification passes on the
  intended commit.

## Independent Viewer package trains

`@menaje/viewer-core`, `@menaje/viewer-render-protocol`, and
`@menaje/viewer-ui` use the separate `viewer-core-v<version>` release train.
`@menaje/viewer-webgl` and `@menaje/dwg-scene-source` use
`viewer-webgl-v<version>`. Their compatibility manifests, normalized archives,
and release workflows remain independent of the VS Code product version.

For a Viewer Core package publication, the three package manifests must have
the same version, the producer manifest must pin each normalized archive's raw
SHA-256, byte length, and content digest, and
`pnpm run qualify:viewer-boundary` must match the checked-in evidence. The tag
workflow additionally requires `tagPublicationApproved: true`, publishes the
same exact versions to GitHub Packages, attaches the three tarballs and
`SHA256SUMS` to the GitHub prerelease, and produces artifact attestations.

## Proposed delivery continuity

Status: plan prepared on 2026-09-12, migration not executed. Source is currently
public and the repository environment remains `hosted-public`. The goal is private
subsequent first-party development with a useful free delivered application.
Future source location and validation profile are undecided; public artifact
access does not determine either. Current package versions and release history
remain observations, not approved candidate identities.

The product maintainer owns free tasks/channels; the release maintainer owns
delivery and release-unit/stage decisions; the licensing maintainer owns
[rights and notices](licensing.md#proposed-free-application-and-interoperability-rights);
API maintainers own package READMEs and [architecture](architecture.md). These are
roles, not a claim that individual release approvers have been designated.
#55's completed owner navigation is reused. Update licensing/distribution prose
at plan review; update package usage, source links, adoption/profile and release
implementation only for an approved concrete transition. No upper-level policy
copy, new manual registration or SDK completion prerequisite is added.

| Existing path | Preserve and verify before any actual change | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `menaje.dwg-viewer-vscode`, manual VSIX and existing release URLs | Existing installations can still obtain their exact release; test old-installed and clean install, update failure, downgrade and last-known-good use without altering user drawings. A replacement link alone does not update an old VSIX. | Product/release maintainer |
| Old VSIX native converter and source archive | `managed-engine.ts` fixes `menaje/2d-cad-viewer` and constructs `/releases/download/<releaseTag>/<asset>` from the embedded catalog. Preserve every supported version/platform converter and corresponding source URL, byte length and digest, including clients without repository authentication. | Native distribution maintainer |
| Core/UI/protocol and WebGL/DWG Scene Source | Preserve exact tag/asset URL, package version, archive/content digest and integrity in existing consumer manifests. Verify the registry separately; release asset availability is not registry availability. | Package maintainer; each consumer owns admission |
| MPL source and GPL source-complete archives | Existing installed README/source links, matching tag source, notices, source offers and platform-specific source archives remain accessible to recipients. Verify the offered source actually matches the distributed payload. | Licensing/release maintainer |
| Future authenticated package access, if selected | Consumer-owned credentials and approved acquisition endpoint; verify install, token denial/expiry, update and rollback against exact bytes. Keep credentials out of archives, logs and other checkouts; preserve a verified prior artifact when new acquisition fails. | Producer availability owner and consumer installation owner |
| Public web entry, if selected | Inventory the actual supported URL/offline assets and demonstrate equivalent free tasks and rollback before replacing it. No hosted web deployment is established by the current source tree alone. | Product delivery maintainer |

Two options remain under comparison:

- Preserve the existing public delivery/history and develop subsequent
  implementation privately. This preserves baked-in URLs most directly, but
  still requires an approved development location and exact release/source
  delivery. It is not approval to create or name a repository.
- Change the existing repository's visibility. Old unauthenticated downloads and
  source links can stop working. Keep this option HOLD until those exact clients
  and URLs, source access, authentication and rollback pass the affected checks.

Neither option may replace historical assets, republish used versions, infer
registry access or restrict already granted OSS rights. Do not migrate a current
consumer merely because a producer starts private development.

Release decisions remain in [#53](https://github.com/menaje/2d-cad-viewer/issues/53):
the three independent trains, durable unit IDs, version/stage authority, numeric
Marketplace projection versus candidate identity, and byte-preserving stable
transition need an explicit release-owner decision. The WebGL workflow's hardcoded
prerelease behavior and mixed historical/development dependencies are preserved
observations. Core 0.1.1 raw-digest discrepancy and registry verification remain
HOLD for their publication/acceptance paths. Native writer/WASM stay under #54.

The execution sequence is plan review, scoped development preparation, approved
delivery/profile implementation with affected validation, then any separately
authorized release. Existing CI/release workflows are unchanged. Record
old-installed/clean-install and failure/rollback results when that transition is
implemented; this plan and read-only URL checks are not those results. The plan
may proceed independently of unrelated product defects or whole-product Effective
status. Revert this documentation by an ordinary reviewed inverse change; no
historical artifact rollback or replacement is needed.
