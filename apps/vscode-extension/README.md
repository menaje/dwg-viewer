# DWG Viewer for VS Code

Open, inspect, search, measure, and export DWG drawings without leaving
VS Code.

DWG Viewer is an open-source, local-first, read-only viewer built for large
drawings, Korean SHX/BigFont text, external references, and paper-space
layouts. Your drawings and fonts stay on your computer.

> This is an early public release. Editing and DWG saving are not available,
> and the separately distributed LibreDWG converter must be connected once
> before opening a drawing.

## Highlights

### Private and read-only

- Drawing conversion, font handling, XREF discovery, and rendering happen
  locally.
- The original DWG is never modified or uploaded.
- A private local cache makes repeat opens faster.

### Korean CAD text support

- Displays `TEXT`, `MTEXT`, `ATTRIB`, and `ATTDEF` content.
- Resolves SHX and BigFont files requested by the drawing.
- Detects legacy EUC-KR, CP949/UHC, and Johab/CP1361 BigFont encodings.
- Lets you connect missing or renamed fonts and falls back to an installed
  Korean font when possible.

### Comfortable navigation on mouse and trackpad

- Click-drag or two-finger scroll to pan.
- Use the mouse wheel or a trackpad pinch to zoom around the pointer.
- Drag a window to zoom, return to the fitted view, move through previous and
  next views, and save named view bookmarks.
- Compact icon tools reveal their names on hover or keyboard focus.
- In-viewer controls follow the VS Code environment language for English and
  Korean.

### Layers, XREFs, and images

- Search layers, toggle visibility, isolate a layer group, invert visibility,
  and restore the previous state.
- Layers are grouped from the current drawing and its actual XREF records.
- Resolves DWG XREFs and JPG/PNG image references across Windows, macOS, and
  Linux path formats.
- Ambiguous or missing references can be selected manually and remembered at
  the source, filename, or folder-mapping level.

### Inspection and measurement

- Select drawing objects to inspect their type, layer, color, and relevant CAD
  properties.
- Measure distance, cumulative distance, area and perimeter, three-point
  angles, radius, and diameter.
- Calibrate a unitless drawing from two known points, then choose display units
  and precision.
- Search `TEXT`, `MTEXT`, `ATTRIB`, and `ATTDEF` across workspace DWGs from the
  Explorer **DWG 문자 검색** view. Selecting a result opens, centers, and
  highlights it.

### Layouts and export

- Switch between model space and paper-space layouts.
- Preserve layout paper size, rotation, viewports, and frozen layers.
- Export the current screen, current tab, or all layouts to PNG or PDF.
- Optionally apply a referenced CTB to a layout for plot colors and
  lineweights.
- All-layout PNG export produces a portable ZIP with the original Unicode
  layout-name mapping.

## Get started

### Requirements

- VS Code 1.125 or newer
- Linux x64, macOS arm64, or Windows x64
- The separately distributed LibreDWG adapter for your platform

### Installation

1. Download `dwg-viewer-vscode-<version>.vsix` and the matching
   `dwg-viewer-libredwg-0.14-<platform>.tar.gz` from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/menaje/dwg-viewer/releases).
2. In VS Code, run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** and select the VSIX.
3. Extract the adapter archive into a folder controlled by your user account.
4. Run **DWG Viewer: LibreDWG 변환기 선택** and select
   `bin/libredwg-adapter`, or `bin\libredwg-adapter.exe` on Windows.
5. Open a `.dwg` file from the Explorer.

The extension checks the selected converter before saving it. You can repeat
that check at any time with **DWG Viewer: LibreDWG 변환기 진단**.

For checksums, provenance verification, macOS security approval, and
platform-specific commands, see the
[distribution and installation guide](https://github.com/menaje/dwg-viewer/blob/main/docs/distribution.md).

## Everyday use

- **Pan:** click-drag or use a two-finger trackpad scroll.
- **Zoom:** use the mouse wheel, trackpad pinch, or window-zoom tool.
- **Find a tool:** hover its icon or move keyboard focus to it.
- **Manage layers:** open the left layer panel and search or change visibility.
- **Inspect or measure:** choose a tool, then select points or objects in the
  drawing.
- **Switch layouts:** use the tabs along the bottom edge of the viewer.
- **Search drawing text:** use the Explorer **DWG 문자 검색** view.
- **Export:** open **PNG/PDF**, choose a scope, and select output options.

The tool shelf and layout tabs remain compact until hovered, keyboard-focused,
or explicitly opened so the drawing can use most of the editor.

## What the viewer displays

- Lines, polylines, arcs, circles, ellipses, and splines
- Blocks, repeated block instances, dimension picture blocks, and nested XREFs
- Solid, gradient, and patterned HATCH content
- POINT, SOLID, 3DFACE, and WIPEOUT content
- CAD text, attributes, Korean SHX/BigFont glyphs, and common MTEXT formatting
- Model space, multiple layouts, viewports, and per-viewport layer freezing
- JPG/PNG IMAGE references and XCLIP boundaries
- Linetypes, colors, transparency, lineweights, and optional layout CTB styles

The viewer loads drawing detail and referenced images as they become useful on
screen, which keeps large drawings responsive without eagerly decoding every
resource.

## Fonts and missing references

After the first drawing frame, the viewer looks only for fonts requested by
the drawing. It checks stored paths, the drawing folder, bounded project
locations, and folders you add through **글꼴 → 글꼴 폴더 추가** or
**DWG Viewer: SHX 글꼴 폴더 추가**.

The font panel distinguishes connected, substituted, ambiguous, missing,
unreadable, and malformed files. You can choose a replacement without exposing
its absolute path to the drawing Webview.

XREFs and images follow a similar local-first flow. The viewer tries portable
path alternatives and a bounded project search, then asks you when it cannot
choose safely. It never searches the whole disk or silently chooses between
equally ranked files.

## Current limitations

- Viewing is read-only; editing, overwriting, and Save As are not available.
- The LibreDWG adapter is a required separate download.
- Embedded OLE content such as an Excel sheet is not rendered; its placement
  frame may still be shown.
- External raster images currently support JPG/JPEG and PNG.
- Missing fonts, XREFs, and images must be connected to the correct local
  files by the user.

## Privacy, license, and source

The VSIX is licensed under MPL-2.0. Its complete source form is available in
the [menaje/dwg-viewer repository](https://github.com/menaje/dwg-viewer),
along with build scripts and third-party notices. The packaged `LICENSE.txt`
contains Mozilla's unmodified MPL 2.0 text, while `NOTICE` contains the project
copyright notice.

The GPL-3.0-or-later LibreDWG adapter is never included in the VSIX. It is
published as a separate platform archive with its corresponding source,
licenses, build scripts, manifest, and checksums. This separation is why the
converter must be selected after installing the extension.

Release artifacts are reproducibly built and include SHA-256 checksums and
GitHub build-provenance attestations. Details are in the
[distribution guide](https://github.com/menaje/dwg-viewer/blob/main/docs/distribution.md).
The component-level license map and review rules are in the
